"""
Single source of truth for operator-voice guard rules.

Canonical Python copy of the rules described in the human-readable companion
`dotfiles/voice/base/VOICE_PROFILE.md` Section 8 (anti-vocabulary) and Section 19
(banned phrases / AI tells the operator never makes).

This module is consumed by:
  - dotfiles/SST3/scripts/check-ai-writing-tells.py  (canonical hook)
  - hoiboy-uk/scripts/check-ai-writing-tells.py      (vendored byte-identical)
  - hoiboy-uk/scripts/voice_rules.py                 (vendored byte-identical)

Drift between canonical and vendored copies is enforced by a `cmp -s` bash
pre-commit hook in hoiboy-uk. There is no parsed mirror of VOICE_PROFILE.md;
the markdown is documentation, this file is the executable canonical.

# "no numbers" — Hoi uses numbers as EVIDENCE; only stat-stacking is the tell.
# The fixture gate `sample_invocation_voice_detectors.py` (AC E.5) is the
# regression guard that keeps these tuned. If a detector cannot be tuned to
# 0 authentic-flags it must fall back to prose-only (documented), NOT ship
# false positives.

# --- markup-stripping (shared) ---
